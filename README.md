Kojak - Koji in a box
=====================

Kojak is a Koji virtual appliance with Mead extentions.  It is part of a productization effort to encourage the
adoption of the the Koji/Mead build system.  The scripts included in this repository create a fully operational
Koji/Mead virtual machine.  They utilise the Libvirtd virtualization API and a kickstart file, based on a vanilla 
Fedora installation, which provides an automated, out of the box solution, that can be used for developement and 
educational purposes.
