Kojak - Koji in a box
=====================

Kojak is a Koji virtual appliance complete with Mead extentions.  It is part of a productization effort to encourage the
adoption of the Koji/Mead build system.  The scripts included in this repository create a fully operational Koji/Mead
virtual machine.  They utilise the Libvirtd virtualization API and a kickstart file, based on a vanilla 
Fedora installation, which provide an automated "out of the box solution", that may be used for developement and 
educational purposes.
